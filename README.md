# Task-List-GUI
This is no less than a normal todo applications where you can create and delte your todos. 
The speciality of this code is that it uses `MongoDB` as a data base to perform operations like create read and delete the task.
`Task List` acts a hybrid GUI as it uses python for db handling and other backend purposes and uses usual HTML/CSS/JS in the frontend.
Thererfore the frontend is highly customable as compared to the same of libraries like tkinter.


## Libraries :-
- `eel` - For Creating an GUI
- `pymongo` - For communicating with the database
